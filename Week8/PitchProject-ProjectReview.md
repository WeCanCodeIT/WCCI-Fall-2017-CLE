# Portfolio
## Due: 05/30/2017 at 9:30AM
**Submission** - Please _**email**_ the required documents to Daniel and Jarryd by the submission time. You can email a Microsoft Word document, share a Google Docs file, or email a PDF.

## Overview
Your project for this weekend is twofold. The first part will consist of you doing research for you final project. The second part will have you looking at three(3) of your previous projects and performing a write up on each, describing how you would improve them. 

## Skills Required
- Writing
- Previous weekend projects from We Can Code IT

## Tasks
- [ ] Pitch Brainstorming
  - [ ] Watch all of the We Can Code IT [Capstone project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0heF6uzr00jmvwbdv74VXzp92xQ-XMeX) videos.
  - [ ] Watch the following video on how to pitch https://www.bizimply.com/resources/Bizimply-Win-Web-Summit-2015/
  - [ ] With your pitch in mind be sure to consider how all the aspects of your training a We Can Code IT will be utilized. Front-end, back-end, styling, and controller logic. Try to stray away from ideas that are just informational sites as those won't touch much back-end programming. 
  - [ ] Build a list of resources that may be useful if you project is selected e.g., APIs, C# libraries, Open Source projects, etc.
  - [ ] Document and refine your pitch. Devote some time to practice it, if you can try practicing in front of friends of family. Remember, all students need to pitch and each student will have 5 minutes. The timeframe includes time for questions too so make sure you don't use all the time on the pitch!
  - [ ] If you are able you can do some field research for your project by reaching out to people or ORGs. Most people are more than happy to provide input for an educational project.
- [ ] Project review
  - [ ] Select 3 of your previous projects to review
  - [ ] For each of your selected project read through project descriptions before looking at the code. Make sure to have a clear idea of the requirements.
  - [ ] Next take a look at the code and begin taking notes on any improvements, changes, or adjustments you could make. Keep in mind that the code should be clear and is often times being read by people when you are not present to explain certain features.
    - [ ] For any improvements try making an attempt at rewriting some of the improved code in. Don't worry about recreating your whole project from scratch, rather focus on improvement.
  - [ ] Try removing the comments from your code. Does your code still make sense? Self documenting code refers to code that is written cleanly, uses familiar conventions, and follows proper naming standards. Comments should be used where the code isn't clear enough on it's own to explain a concept. Take notes on this but don't feel like you need to remove all coments from your future code.
    - [ ] There are a lot of resources on [self documenting code](https://www.google.com/search?q=self+documenting+code&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS698US698&oq=self+documenting+code&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j0l4.3157j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) if you're interestd in learning more.

## Details
For this weekend's project it's divided up into two parts. 

The first part will have you work on honing down your pitch for final projects. First begin on collecting as much information as you can. From there work on narrowing it down. Feel free to talk and work with your classmates on narrowing down your ideas if you feel like it may be too large. Also run your idea past a number of different people to get feedback.

Once you have your pitch ready put some time into practicing it.  It will just be for your classmates and We Can Code IT staff so don't put too much pressure on yourself.

Submit a summary page of your notes.

--

For your project review you should aim to have a couple pages of documentation. Each project you review should contain code samples, explanations as to why the old code is not sufficient, and how you would make improvements to the code. If you want to it would be beneficial to include rewritten and improved code.

## Hints
Have fun!
Do some research on different programming practices. Try searhcing for SOLID, Clean Code and other methodologies.
