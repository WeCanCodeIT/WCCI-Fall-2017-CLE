- [ ] Pitch Brainstorming
  - [ ] Watch all of the We Can Code IT [Capstone project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0heF6uzr00jmvwbdv74VXzp92xQ-XMeX) videos.
  - [ ] Watch the following video on how to pitch https://www.bizimply.com/resources/Bizimply-Win-Web-Summit-2015/
  - [ ] With your pitch in mind be sure to consider how all the aspects of your training a We Can Code IT will be utilized. Front-end, back-end, styling, and controller logic. Try to stray away from ideas that are just informational sites as those won't touch much back-end programming. 
  - [ ] Build a list of resources that may be useful if you project is selected e.g., APIs, C# libraries, Open Source projects, etc.
  - [ ] Document and refine your pitch. Devote some time to practice it, if you can try practicing in front of friends of family. Remember, all students need to pitch and each student will have 5 minutes. The timeframe includes time for questions too so make sure you don't use all the time on the pitch!
  - [ ] If you are able you can do some field research for your project by reaching out to people or ORGs. Most people are more than happy to provide input for an educational project.

## Details

This weekend you will work on honing down your pitch for final projects. First begin on collecting as much information as you can. From there, work on narrowing it down. Feel free to talk and work with your classmates on narrowing down your ideas if you feel like it may be too large. Also run your idea past a number of different people to get feedback.

Once you have your pitch ready put some time into practicing it.  It will just be for your classmates and We Can Code IT staff so don't put too much pressure on yourself.


## Hints
Have fun!
Do some research on different programming practices. Try searching for SOLID, Clean Code and other methodologies.
